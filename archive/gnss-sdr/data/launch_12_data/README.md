This is attempt to process the GPS data from PSAS's Launch 12. Currently does not work.

Use FixSigned.c to fix the IQ data into a format that uses Two's Complement.

Launch 12 GPS data can be found Launch-12 repo Launch-12/data/GPS/. [here] (https://github.com/psas/Launch-12/tree/gh-pages/data/GPS)
